              <p>
                If you or a loved one have been in an auto accident, you may be
                feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. The aftermath of a car
                accident can affect your personal and professional life as you
                deal with the physical, emotional, and financial burdens that an
                accident can cause. If you are struggling with the legalities of
                a car accident, then you want an experienced and knowledgeable
                car accident attorney by your side.
              </p>
              <p>
                At The Rode Law Firm, a personal injury firm with locations in
                Tulsa and Sapulpa, Oklahoma, we are focused on client recovery
                from auto accidents and severe injuries. We represent people in
                the Tulsa, Sapulpa, Broken Arrow, Sand Springs, and Owasso,
                Oklahoma areas who have suffered injuries in car accidents by
                providing professional representation both in and out of the
                courtroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are involved in a car accident, the steps you take
                afterward directly affect your recovery. Having the nearest law
                enforcement agency investigate the wreck and a visit to the ER
                are prudent and highly recommended. Many injuries, such as a
                herniated disc or a concussion, may be disguised until weeks or
                months after the accident. Your well-being should be your number
                one priority.

                The legal process can be confusing, so you may be wondering: how
                long will the process take? The answer to this question is
                dependent upon your recovery time for any injuries you may have
                sustained, how your insurance company responds to your claim,
                and whether or not we need to go to trial. No matter what, your
                attorneys at The Rode Law Firm will be by your side to answer
                any questions or concerns as best we can.
